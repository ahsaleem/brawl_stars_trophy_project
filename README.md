# Trophy Graph maker
# Video Demo: https://youtube.com/shorts/aL-FWnuhhYg?feature=share
 → python program that when given a brawl stars tag, will calculate expected trophies for every brawler

 → users will be presented with 4 pre-determined options: over-performing brawlers, under-performing brawlers, expected trophies, and a graph of expected vs actual (can be expanded to support other options such as brawler strength calculator, deviation in strength e.t.c) 
 
 → flask website in progress maybe

 → comments within the code explain the functionality

 ## Prerequisites:
 → matplotlib
 
 → brawlstats 
 
 → numpy

 ## Usage:
 → have the required modules installed beforehand
 
 → make sure to input your own brawl stars api key (https://developer.brawlstars.com/#/)
 
 → tag can be found on account profile: go to profile and underneath your profile icon, you will find your tag

 

 Warning: this project is likely outdated and not up-to-date with the game due to the base API not having such features available for free. For more accurate statistics regarding strength see https://brawltime.ninja/ or https://brawlstats.com/.
